# Fruit-Vegetable-Classifier
A classifier that distinguishes between 5 different kinds of fruits and 5 different kinds of vegetables. 

The Neural Network's architecture is: 
CONV2D(32) -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D(64) -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D(128) -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D(128) -> MAXPOOL -> DENSE(512) -> DENSE(10)I
